# webpack-virtual-module-api
:gift: a virtual-module-api for webpack. [wip]

### Introduction:
To create a module in webpack, webpack will create a file with your bundled code. 
This project would tackle this problem, which is that you want to run a webpack build and run a server with your bundled code without having to create a file on the disk. 
This feature is a highly wanted one, and will save developers space in their projects while preserving their workflow in development mode.

### NOTE :
* Open to any kind of suggestion.
